   <p>1.The homepage contains nine pull-down menus: home, table, natural Product, target, derivative, search, tools, help and contact in the toolbar, and users can browse relevant entries by clicking their submenus. Then the corresponding entries will be displayed.
   </p>
   <p>Natural Product page contains Basic information,Structure Information,Target Information,Related Derivatives MMP Information. 
     Derivative page is the same as Natural Product page.

   <p>Target page contains Target Details,Related Natural Products and Derivatives MMP Information.

   <p>2.In the search page, users can input keywords, such as natural Product name , target type, derivative id etc.
      Users can also search by properties ranges, including alogp, molecule weight, hbd, hba and rtb. In the left and right boxes, enter the minimum and maximum values respectively. 
   </p>

   <p>Alternatively, users can search a specific structure by sketching it in the JME applet window.
      Three kinds of structure type can be selected, including substructure search, similarity search and MMP search. 
      After clicking the “Search” button, matched structures will be displayed in a few seconds.

   <p>3.In the tools page, users can apply the MV-SEA online computing algorithm tool to predict possible targets of query molecules on the “Target Prediction” submenu. 
     Structures can be input by drawing in the JME applet window, or typing the “SMILES” string. 
     Users can also upload a file with multiple molecules (at most 1000) stored in sdf or SMILES formats. 
     To obtain the target prediction result, users should provide a valid e-mail address and click “Target Prediction(MV-SEA)” button to submit a job. 
     The potential protein target list will be sent to your email.
